Documentation is limited but will soon be underway as well as significant code-cleanup.

All libraries compiled and linked with with MSVS 2010 "Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 16.00.30319.01 for 80x86".

Documentation needs to be created to easily understand how to even begin to use this project (which will be completed soon).

Due to utilizing winsock (reference "connection" project), this project requires a Windows platform and is not known to be portable.
